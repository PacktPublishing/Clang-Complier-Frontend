\lhead{clang-tidy linter framework}
There is an introduction to clang-tidy - the clang-based linter framework that
uses AST to find anti-patterns in the C/C++/Objective-C code. First, we will start with
a clang-tidy description, what kind of checks it has and how we can use
them. Later we will investigate the clang-tidy architecture and how we can
create our custom lint check.

\section{Results in the case of compilation errors}
As we noticed in \fullref{sec:ast:errors}, compilation errors might produce
strange results for lint checks and there is an example.
