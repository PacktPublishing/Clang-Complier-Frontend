\chapter*{\textbf{Part 2:\\
    Clang tools}}

\begin{flushleft}

You can find some info about different clang tools here. We will start with
linters that are based on clang-tidy, continue with some advanced code analysis
techniques (CFG and live time analysis). The next chapter will be about
different refactoring tools such as clang-format. The last chapter will be about
IDE support. We are going to investigate how VSCode can be extended with
language server provided by LLVM (clangd).
