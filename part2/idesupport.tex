\lhead{IDE support and code navigation}

 The chapter is about Language Server Protocol (LSP) and how you can use it to
 extend your IDE. As the primary IDE, we will use VSCode. LLVM has its
 implementation of LSP as clangd. We will start with a typical usage scenario,
 continue with implementation details and finish with our custom extension for
 LSP that we must implement on both client (VSCode extension) and server
 (clangd) sides.
