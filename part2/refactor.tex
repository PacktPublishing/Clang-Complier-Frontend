\lhead{Refactoring tools}
 The chapter is about code refactoring tools. For example, suppose you want to
 modify a set of files according to a new code style or want to detect and fix a
 specific problem in your project. The code modification tools can help here. We
 will start with a typical usage scenario and finish with our custom code
 modification tool.
