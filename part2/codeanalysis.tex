he clang-tidy checks from the previous chapter can be considered based on an
advanced matching provided by AST. However, it might not be enough when you want
to detect some complex problems, such as lifetime issues. We will introduce
advanced code analysis tools based on CFG (control flow graph). The clang static
analyser is an excellent example of such devices, but we also have some CFG
integration into clang-tidy. The chapter will start with typical usage examples
and continue with implementation details. We will finish with our custom check
that uses advanced techniques.
